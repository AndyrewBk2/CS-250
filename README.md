How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In my opinion looking at user needs is very important to finding and creating solutions that deliver user needs. User stories break down sections that are cleary stated by the developers solution.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
After learning about Agile and Scrum techniques, I believe my approach to designing applications will be less concerned with changing definitions. The primary focus, in my opinion, is to deliver working software. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? A good team member in software development fully supports the agile concepts of honesty and transparency. It is important to collaborate with others while writing code that is understandable to testers, Scrum Masters, and Product Owners. A good team member is totally focused on producing high-quality products that suit the needs of both the customer and the end-user when working with his or her colleagues.
